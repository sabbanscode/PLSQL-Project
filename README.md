# Sports Tournament Database Management-PL-SQL
## Project created by:
Sabban Shubham Vijay Student of Amrutwahini College of Engineering from Computer Engineering Depatrment (under Zensar SQL and Python Training)
## Project Description:
The Sports Tournament Database Management System is a robust solution designed to efficiently manage and organize data related to sports tournaments. This system enables users to handle critical aspects of tournament management, such as tracking teams, players, matches, and overall standings, ensuring data consistency and accuracy through advanced database techniques.
With features like dynamic updates of player and team statistics using triggers and procedural logic, the system is tailored to provide real-time insights into tournament progress. It is ideal for organizing various types of sports tournaments, providing a reliable and scalable platform to manage complex data operations effortlessly.
Built with SQL and PL/SQL, this project demonstrates best practices in database design, making it a valuable tool for both practical use in sports management and as a learning resource for database technologies.
## Key Features:
1.Comprehensive Team and Player Management:
-Store and manage details of teams and their players.
-Track individual player statistics, including goals, assists, and matches played.

2.Dynamic League Standings:
-Automatically calculate and update team standings (wins, draws, losses, points, and matches played) based on match results.
-Real-time updates using triggers to ensure data consistency.

3.Player Performance Tracking:
-Use PL/SQL procedures to dynamically update player statistics after each match.
-Evaluate playersâ€™ contributions to their teams, such as goals scored and assists.
## Technologies Used:
PL/SQL (Oracle Database) SQL (for queries,stored procedures)
## Guidance:
Project created under the guidance of Sir Aniruddh Gaikwad.
